# TensoRFvis

The goal of this library is real-time TensoRF visualization using the PlenOctrees web viewer. It is based on the [nerfvis](https://github.com/sxyu/nerfvis) library by Alex Yu.

## Docs

Currently in progress. Please see the [nerfvis](https://github.com/sxyu/nerfvis) repo and the [companion website](https://nerfvis.readthedocs.org) if you are in a hurry. It has documented almost all the functions in this library and includes code examples.

## The TensoRF Renderer
Please follow [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/UPstartDeveloper/NeRF-to-XR/issues/26) for progress on our upcoming TensoRF renderer.
